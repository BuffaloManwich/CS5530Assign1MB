In Assignment 1 part 1, I was given a relatively small dataset that relates
grip strength in women and medically defined fraility.
The task is to design a workflow to import, process, and analyze the dataset.
The importing and preprocessing should be automated. Sorting and visualization
should be as automated as possible. If these are done properly, the workflow
should yield reproducible results.
The first step was to create a Data.csv file. I copied over the table to OpenOfficeCalc.
That took a little formatting, then I saved the table as a CSV file. This also took
bit of formatting. Thusly, Data1a.CSV was created.
Then I loaded up Visual Studios and created a new python application.
Installed the necessary libraries (I had to install Python 3.12 via Microsoft Store first).
Once the console was ready, I added a folder Data, and transferred the Data1a.CSV to the folder.
The Visual Studio environment was not working once I set up some code and tried to execute.
This led me to use Google Colab to run the initial small dataset analysis.
Colab ran real well. The virualized Pyhton environment ran the test codes well.

I am going to attempt to run the Part 2 analysis on VSCode.

VS Code worked well. 



VS Code worked very well in Python!

As you can see, initializing the main.py file generated many .png and a few .html files.
