# In Assignment 1 part 1, I was given a relatively small dataset that relates
grip strength in women and medically defined fraility.
# The task is to design a workflow to import, process, and analyze the dataset.
# The importing and preprocessing should be automated. Sorting and visualizating
should be as automated as possible. If these are done properly, the workflow
should yield reproducible results.
# The first step was to create a Data.csv file. I copied over the table to OpenOfficeCalc.
# That took a little formatting, then I saved the table as a CSV file. This also took
a bit of formatting. Thusly, Data1a.CSV was created.
# Then I loaded up Visual Studios and created a new python application.
# Installed the necessary libraries (I had to install Python 3.12 via Microsoft Store first).
# Once the console was ready, I added a folder Data, and transferred the Data1a.CSV to the folder.
