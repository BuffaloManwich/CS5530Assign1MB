# In Assignment 1 part 1, I was given a relatively small dataset that relates
# grip strength in women and medically defined fraility.
# The task is to design a workflow to import, process, and analyze the dataset.
# The importing and preprocessing should be automated. Sorting and visualizating
# should be as automated as possible. If these are done properly, the workflow
# should yield reproducible results.
